   <p>I've always loved reading. Recently, however, I've found myself short on time and unable to read as often as I would like. As a result of this, I have found it necessary to be more selective with my reading choices.

   To assist, I have made this application that will randomly select a book to read from lists of award-winning titles. Currently a user can only select from lists that have either won the National Book Award or the Pulitzer Prize in one of the following categories: Fiction, Non-Fiction, or Poetry, but more lists will be added in the future, including a lists of my personal favorite books.</p>
