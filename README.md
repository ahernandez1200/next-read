# next-read *in progress*

*A web app that will help you find your next read!*

## Purpose
---
I've always loved reading. Recently, however, I've found myself short on time and unable to read as often as I would like. As a result of this, I have
found it necessary to be more selective with my reading choices. 

To assist, I have made this application that will randomly select a book to read from lists of award-winning titles. Currently, a user
can only select from lists that have either won the National Book Award or the Pulitzer Prize in one of the following categories: Fiction, Non-Fiction, or
Poetry, but more lists will be added in the future, including a lists of my personal favorite books. 

## How it Works
---
Python was initially used to scrape the desired book titles off Wikipedia and put them into text files. From there, those titles are read into a JavaScript/Web app
that displays information related to those book titles -- like Author, publication date, book cover, etc... -- with the help of Google's *Books API*. 

## Give it a Try!
